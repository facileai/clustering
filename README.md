# clustering
The goal is pretty clear. you have a bunch of data from which you may or may not know the generative distrubition. you want to learn the structure of the data in a such way simular data are grouped together.

We cover two types of Clustering, the Hard clustering using K-means where an observation needs to absolutely belong to one cluster and the soft clustering using Gaussian Mixtures Models. Unlike K-Means, with Gaussian Mixture Models we want to define a probability distribution on the data
